# Text_Classifier

I have created a text classifier which gives an output of 'Spam' or 'Ham'.

The data was first preprocessed.

I did some EDA on the data and then passed it through a number of classification algorithms from which I selected the best one.

I used streamlit for making a UI for the project.
